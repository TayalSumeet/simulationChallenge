DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Simulation Parameters:
  Initial investment: $30,000
  Time period: 22 years (age 53 to 75)
  Number of simulations: 100

Distribution Statistics:
  Mean final balance:      $110,074.45
  Median final balance:    $9,414.32
  Standard deviation:      $348,312.97
  Minimum final balance:   $6.17
  Maximum final balance:   $2,298,417.45

================================================================================
PROBABILITY OF FAVORABLE OUTCOMES
================================================================================
  P(final balance &gt; $30,000):     27.0% (27/100 simulations)
  P(final balance ≥ $60,000):   15.0% (15/100 simulations)
  P(final balance ≥ $30,000):    27.0% (break-even or better)

================================================================================
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

After running 100 simulations of the investment game over 22 years:

1. DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS:
   • The distribution is highly skewed with a long right tail
   • Mean balance ($110,074.45) is higher than median ($9,414.32)
   • This indicates extreme outcomes: some simulations result in very high balances,
     while others result in significant losses
   • The wide range ($6.17 to $2,298,417.45) shows high variability

2. PROBABILITY OF HAPPY OUTCOMES:
   • After investing $30,000, the probability of ending with MORE than your initial
     investment is 27.0%
   • This means in 27 out of 100 simulations,
     you would be profitable
   • The probability of at least DOUBLING your money is 15.0%

3. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   • Less than half of simulations result in profit - this is a HIGH RISK investment
   • The high standard deviation ($348,312.97) indicates significant uncertainty
   • You could lose as much as $29,993.83 or gain as much as $2,268,417.45

4. CONCLUSION:
   • If you define 'happy outcomes' as finishing with more than your $30,000 investment,
     the probability is 27.0%
   • However, the extreme variability means outcomes are highly unpredictable

COMPARISON: Original vs Modified Strategy (50% at Risk)
================================================================================

ORIGINAL STRATEGY (Full Balance at Risk):
  Mean final balance:        $71,813.97
  Median final balance:      $9,414.32
  Standard deviation:        $173,648.68

  P(final &gt; $30,000):        28.00%
  Profitable simulations:    28/100

MODIFIED STRATEGY (50% of Balance at Risk):
  Mean final balance:        $59,119.58
  Median final balance:      $30,000.00
  Standard deviation:        $77,117.14
  Minimum:                   $844.42
  Maximum:                   $436,557.46
  P(final &gt; $30,000):        48.00%
  Profitable simulations:    48/100

COMPARISON:

  Max difference:            $-482,809.52
  Min difference:            $603.42
  Probability gain diff:     20.00%

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION: Which is Riskier? Which has Better Upside?
================================================================================
  • The ORIGINAL strategy is RISKIER (std dev: $173,648.68 vs $77,117.14)
    → Higher volatility means more uncertainty
  • The ORIGINAL strategy has BETTER UPSIDE (max: $919,366.98 vs $436,557.46)
    → Can achieve much higher maximum returns

  • The modified strategy (50% at risk) has:
    - Lower risk per year (25% gain vs 50% gain, 20% loss vs 40% loss)
    - More conservative approach
    - Lower maximum potential but also lower minimum loss

KELLY CRITERION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Game Parameters:
  Probability of winning (heads): 50.0%
  Probability of losing (tails): 50.0%
  Gain on win: 50.0% (multiply by 1.5)
  Loss on loss: 40.0% (multiply by 0.6)

Kelly Criterion Calculation:
  Expected return per bet: 5.0%
  Kelly optimal fraction: 25.0%
  This means: bet 25.0% of your balance each round

Interpretation:
  • The Kelly Criterion suggests betting 25.0% of your balance
  • This maximizes long-term growth rate
  • Betting more than 25.0% increases risk without increasing growth
  • Betting less than 25.0% is safer but suboptimal for growth

Comparison to Our Strategies:
  • Original strategy: bets 100% of balance (full risk)
  • Modified strategy: bets 50% of balance (partial risk)
  • Kelly optimal: bets 25.0% of balance

  • The modified strategy (5000.0%) is closer to the Kelly optimal
    than the original strategy (100%)
================================================================================</code></pre>

</div>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Kelly Criterion</strong> is a mathematical formula that determines the optimal fraction of your capital to bet in repeated favorable gambles to maximize long-term growth rate. Developed by John Kelly in 1956, it balances the trade-off between maximizing returns and avoiding ruin.</p>
<p><strong>For this investment game:</strong> - Heads (50% chance): gain 50% → win multiplier = 1.5 - Tails (50% chance): lose 40% → loss multiplier = 0.6</p>
<p>The Kelly formula calculates the optimal betting fraction as approximately <strong>25%</strong> of your balance each round. This maximizes the expected logarithmic growth of your wealth over time by balancing the potential gains against the risk of losses.</p>
<p><strong>Relation to our findings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Original strategy (100% at risk)</strong>: This over-bets compared to Kelly. While it can achieve higher maximum returns, it also has much higher variance and risk of significant losses. The Kelly Criterion would suggest this is too aggressive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modified strategy (50% at risk)</strong>: This is still above the Kelly optimal of 25%, but much closer to it than the original strategy. While it’s still double the Kelly recommendation, it reduces risk significantly while maintaining reasonable upside potential. The lower volatility and more consistent outcomes align better with Kelly’s principle of maximizing long-term growth rather than short-term gains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key insight</strong>: The Kelly Criterion explains why betting your full balance (original strategy) is suboptimal - it maximizes volatility rather than growth. The modified strategy, by betting only 50%, moves closer to the Kelly optimal and should theoretically provide better risk-adjusted returns over the long run, even if it has lower maximum potential.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Practical implication</strong>: The Kelly Criterion suggests that even with a positive expected value game, you should not bet your entire balance. The optimal strategy balances growth potential with risk management, which is exactly what the modified (50% at risk) strategy attempts to do.</p>
